The shapes of `0-25` and `33-127` are from `pointsGrob` of `grid`, the `26-32` are from `starGrob` of [`ggstar`](https://github.com/xiangpin/ggstar).

> This package will be deprecated, because it is too slow, especially for big datasets. Some shapes of `pointsGrob` also has been developed by [`ggstar`](https://github.com/xiangpin/ggstar), it is faster than `ggsymbol`, so it will be developed and maintained in the future.
