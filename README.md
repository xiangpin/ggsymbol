To create symbol layer, I developed this package. It integrated the
shapes of ‘R base’ and some regular polygon shapes of ‘ggstar’. It was
built with the merits of ‘ggplot2’ that was based on the grammar of
graphics. So it can be easily used.

The shapes of `0-25` and `33-127` are from `pointsGrob` of `grid`, the
`26-32` are from `starGrob` of
[`ggstar`](https://github.com/xiangpin/ggstar).

> This package will be deprecated, because it is too slow, especially
> for big datasets. Some shapes of `pointsGrob` also has been developed
> by [`ggstar`](https://github.com/xiangpin/ggstar), it is faster than
> `ggsymbol`, so it will be developed and maintained in the future.

library(ggsymbol)
p3 <- ggplot(data=iris,
             mapping=aes(x=Petal.Length,
                         y=Petal.Width,
                         fill=Species,
                         symbol=Species)) +
      geom_symbol() + scale_symbol_manual(values=c(27, 23, 21))
